        Setup-YTTS

Then we use abbreviations  I drive for Youhas trucking 
YTD driver  
when we creat a 
Driver the folder will look like this YTD-FFixed1220
you can use any employ code you want. make it simple 
month and year
   YTTS-sort
   
lok on demo https://github.com/Drakeo/Youhas-trucking-test-scripts/tree/master/youhas-trucking
sort is the BEAST of the system. 
It lets you grab BOL'S Bill of Ladings or recipts and anytime
it puts them in weekly monthly yearly
if you do billing once a week. set it to run by it's self once a week
it also seperate your customers BOL's, Weekly Monthly Yearly

    YTTS-split
    
 look on demo https://github.com/Drakeo/Youhas-trucking-test-scripts/tree/master/youhas-trucking/Splits
This is a powerfull tool and still in development as i write this
driver drops trailer scans BOL's names them split-company code-bol numbers-driver acount-date
codes hy-Hyster mc-MC Mlaine sy-Sygma fa-Fapco wlm-WalMart etc etc
notice all lower case
  split-wlm-ffixed1220-4-06-19  
easier on a smartphone. this system will be able to mesh with  windows and mac
both of them have issues with caps letter have the time do not reconize them

       YTTS-payroll
       
!!!!!! use only when all sorting is done from drivers BOL's !!!!!!!!!!!
why because it grabs all the drivers BOL's and puts them in there driver boil folder.
So they can see all bills and date.
And you are enable to sort anything till new BOL's come in.
yes you can fix that but hey copy paste to death
look on demo https://github.com/Drakeo/Youhas-trucking-test-scripts/tree/master/youhas-trucking/Drivers/YTD-Brent1220 

Or we use git-hub as a back up and can go to any moment at anytime
we do this by tags or revision 
 enter your git hub on you computer and git checkout.
 when you run any program  YTTS-? it calls YTTS-rsync  makes a copy of your dropbox then 
 commits all the changes to git and sends them to your online github.
 commits will be named uploads_plus the seconds of the year. yes how many seconds in a day
look at demo here https://github.com/Drakeo/Youhas-trucking-test-scripts/commits/master you will see bunch of these

 I wrote it to walk you through it is simple
 if you mess up it will let you know.
 
 What it does read the script.
 
  Here are your options.
 Add An employee first letter of first name then first letter
         of last name example the month and year born JDoe0216.
 Remove An employee .
 Add a truck or trailer .
 Remove a truck or trailer .
 Remove an Employee truck or trailer 
        Places it in the Deactivated folder .
 Reminder spelling , add-truck , add-trailer , add-employee .
 Reminder spelling , rm-truck , rm-trailer , rm-employee .
                                
    Copy paste right from here may help Ok  what do you want to do. .

    after add-ing truck or a trailer it creates a qr scan and 
    opens firfox to your dropbox and ask you to create a link
    so all the drivers and shippers can use it.
